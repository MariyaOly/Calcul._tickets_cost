TASK: For the online conference you need to write a program that will calculate the total cost of tickets. The program should work as follows:

1. In the beginning, the user is asked for the number of tickets he wants to buy for the event.

2. Then for each ticket the age of the visitor is requested, according to the value of which the price is chosen:

-From 18 to 25 years old - 9.90 Eur

-From 25 years old - full price 13.90 Eur

-If the conference attendee is under 18 years of age, they attend the conference for free.

3. The program outputs the amount to be paid. At that, if a person registers more than three people to the conference, he/she gets additional 10% discount on the full cost of the order.
